###### **Music purchase App**

A command line application that allows the selection of a song to purchase using command line.

---------------------------------------------------------------

**Statement of Purpose**

What does the application do?
the goal of my command line application is to simply allow a user to choose one of a preset list of songs then proceed to a checkout which will take a mock payment via email and card input.

---------------------------------------------------------------

**What business problem does this address?**

With the ease of access to music production software a lot of musicians can have trouble earning an income from distributors who take a portion of the income or from online streaming services who pay a few dollars per thousand plays. This application will allow the selling of ones music without the distributors tax and allow fans to support this with purchases directly from the artist(s).

1. User is greeted and shown a display of songs.

2. User can input into command line for the song they want and decide if they want to proceed to checkout or choose a different song.

3. User is greeted with the checkout screen that requires the input of their email for delivery of product and a mock card payment input for payment.
